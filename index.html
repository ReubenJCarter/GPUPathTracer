<h1>GPU Path Tracer</h1>

<h2> Intro </h2>
<p>

The point of this project is mostly educational. A few years ago, when I was still at uni, I watched a demo video for Brigade 
(Perhaps it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpT6MkCeP7Y" target="_blank">this<a/>).
I was seriously impressed. I wanted to learn how systems such as octane and brigade actually work,
this led me down a rather long and winding path which I am still on.
For a day job I build systems to render billions of particles mostly from laser scan data which goes 
into <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04pt0n7" target="_blank">TV shows</a>,<>VR Experences<> and the like.
Most of this work is based on quite traditional game engine style particle systems, essentially rasterising loads 
of little quads (lots of OpenGL and clever out of core data structures etc.) But not a lot of lighting!
My aim with this project is to build a fast GPU based path tracing engine to learn how to simulate light and make
photorealistic images really fast. I hope to document all of my findings here.

<h2>Path Tracing</h2>
<p>
Path tracing is a technique which produces really stunning photorealistic images. It is basicly a simulation of light, if you consider light to be a lot of rays 
emmited by a source, bouncing around a scene off surfaces with certain properties and then becoming incident on the photosensitive part of a camera or eye.
This may not be a particulally accuate physical model for light, we know that light is wavelike under certain conditions, and certainly does not bounce around like
a newtonian billiard ball. But for rendering images of everyday materials and scenes in a macroscopic world, its not bad.
The briliant thing about path tracing is that all of the
complex lighting effects (soft shadows AO DOF Caustics) are produced natrurally as a byproduct of simulating light. It's Incredably elligant,
however it suffers from being extremaly computationally expensive, and has been out of reach for anything realtime, and even most things non realtime for quite a while. 
Even without any further explination, it may be clear why path tracing is so expensive, for any standard scene there is an almost limitless quantity of 
light rays bouncing around in limitless directions and numbers of bounces, to eventually excite a single pixel in the camera.

rendering equation formal 

$$L_o(\mathbf x,\omega_o) = L_e(\mathbf x,\omega_o) + \int_\Omega fr(\mathbf x,\omega_i,\omega_o)Li(\mathbf x, \omega_i)\omega_i\cdot n,d\omega_i$$

reverse directon ie cam rays start .

montecarlo to solve
